The `initial` folder contains a Grails 3 application created with the `web` profile.
It has several Controllers, GORM Data Services, Domain classes and a simple CRUD interface built with http://gsp.grails.org[GSP]s.
It is an app to list tourism resources; hotels, restaurants, and points of interest.

In the next sections, you are going to add a feature to the app. Each of those resources may include a
 featured image.

* For restaurants, we are going to store the image bytes directly in the domain class.

* For points of interest, we transfer the file to a folder.

* For hotels, we upload the file to AWS S3.
